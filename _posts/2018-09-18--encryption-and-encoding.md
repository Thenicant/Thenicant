    <td>We started by looking at our passwords. A password with 1 letter, number or punctuation can have 52 possibilities. However  there are computers that can process 512 numbers at one time. This is why we need encryption. Encryption provides multiple layers of code that the computer needs to break through.</td>

    <td>I put my hand up to ask a question but I think this confused things for me. It passed over my head when we got onto the topic of maths calculations, and how high Google can count up to.</td>

    <td>Next time I will save my question for later so I can understand the current subject/topic. This will enhance my learning, so I can be the best I can be.</td>
