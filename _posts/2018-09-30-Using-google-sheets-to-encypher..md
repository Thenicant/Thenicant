    <th>Questioning?</th>

    <td>Finding out how to color in the cells on our own.</td>

    <td>I could have made more of an effort to ask why sheets did that. For example when you say "vlookup" and then a cell, why then do you have to say where you want to look. Surely it just takes the number or letter out of that particular cell. In addition to this what is the point of using “false” or “true” in such a small list. Is the computer not quick enough to search through those numbers quick enough. And even if there is a point why don't you just use true as it would be quicker. </td>

    <td>So next time I would like to question why the computer does a specific task when you input a specific piece of code. Therefore I will know what i’m actually doing rather than just doing it. Just doing it will not teach me how to apply it later in life, so it is better to learn nw than learn later.  </td>
